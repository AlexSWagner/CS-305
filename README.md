# CS-305
This repository contains my completed CS-305 Project One. It includes a vulnerability assessment for Artemis Financial's RESTful web application, identifying security vulnerabilities and recommending mitigation strategies to ensure robust protection against external threats.
# Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment

## Project Overview

### Client and Software Requirements

**Client:** Artemis Financial, a consulting company specializing in personalized financial plans, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.

**Software Requirements:** The client required a comprehensive assessment of their RESTful web application to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities, ensuring robust protection against external threats and compliance with modern security standards.

### Addressed Issues

The primary issue addressed was identifying and documenting security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's web-based application. This included a manual code review and static testing using the dependency-check plug-in.

## Achievements and Importance of Secure Coding

### Successes in Identifying Vulnerabilities

**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities?**
The vulnerability assessment successfully identified several critical security issues, such as SQL injection risks, lack of input validation, and outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities. 

**Why is it important to code securely?**
Coding securely is crucial for preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information. 

**What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**
Software security adds significant value to a company's overall well-being by safeguarding its reputation, protecting customer data, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

### Challenging Aspects

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
The most challenging part was the manual review process, which required meticulous inspection of the code to identify potential vulnerabilities. This process was essential in understanding the depth and variety of security issues that could affect the application.

### Increasing Layers of Security

**How did you increase layers of security?**
To enhance security, multiple layers were implemented, including input validation, authorization checks, encryption of data in transit using TLS, and proper error handling.

**In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**
In future assessments, employing automated security testing tools alongside manual reviews will provide a comprehensive understanding of potential vulnerabilities.

## Ensuring Functionality and Security

### Refactoring and Testing

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure?**
After refactoring the code to address identified vulnerabilities, rigorous testing was conducted to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. 

**After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
This included running the dependency-check plug-in again and performing functional tests to verify the application's behavior remained intact.

### Helpful Resources and Practices

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
Several resources and tools proved invaluable, including the Maven dependency-check plug-in, secure coding guidelines, and best practices for input validation and encryption. These tools and practices will continue to be essential in future assignments and professional tasks.

## Showcasing Skills to Employers

### Project Highlights

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
This project demonstrates the ability to conduct thorough vulnerability assessments, implement effective mitigation strategies, and ensure the security and functionality of software applications. Future employers will see my skills in secure coding, vulnerability identification, and remediation, reflecting a strong understanding of software security principles.
